## Coding Best Practices
- **Do not modify code or UI elements that already work**, unless explicitly instructed.
- Avoid duplicating existing functionality; reuse working components whenever possible.
- Write comprehensive tests for all new or modified functionality.
- **Never unintentionally delete data or code**; confirm explicitly before destructive actions.
- Commit frequently to maintain a reliable project history.
- Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- Organize code into clearly separated modules, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- Use clear, consistent imports (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Always ask clarifying questions if tasks or requirements are unclear.**

## User Interface (UI)
- **Never change or affect the UI unintentionally.** Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task.
- Always ensure UI changes are fully tested and validated.
