## Documentation Usage
- Always consult the project's **`1 PRD.md`** file located at the project root for clear understanding of goals and features.
- Review all additional documentation files within the **`docs`** directory provided with the project.
- If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, ) to locate official and current sources online.

## Technical Stack Compliance
- **Adhere strictly to the project's established technology stack.**
- Do not introduce new technologies unless explicitly instructed and justified.
- You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user confirmation.
