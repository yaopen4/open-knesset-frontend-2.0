## Information Gathering (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl)
- Use **Brave Search and Puppetee MCP servers** when troubleshooting, searching documentation, or exploring similar user issues.
- Combine effectively with **Sequential Thinking MCP** to refine solutions and acquire up-to-date information.
- Prioritize reliable and concise sources.

## GitHub MCP
- Commit and push code changes to GitHub using the **GitHub MCP server** after every successful test.
- Ensure commits are clear, descriptive, and incremental.
- Never overwrite or unintentionally alter files like README.md or other critical documentation without explicit user approval.
