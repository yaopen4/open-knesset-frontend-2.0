Project: כנסת פתוחה Open Knesset – Website Revamp



1. Project Overview

Summary:
The project is a comprehensive revamp of the existing “Open Knesset” platform (https://oknesset.org/), aiming to make Israeli parliamentary data more accessible, clear, and user-friendly for citizens initially, with secondary audiences including journalists, developers, researchers, and policymakers.

Problem Statement:
The current platform provides rich datasets but suffers from dated UI, limited interactivity, and inconsistent visual hierarchy, which can hinder user engagement and comprehension.

Value Proposition:

Clarity: Users can easily navigate and interpret complex parliamentary data.

Accessibility: Daily-updated information is presented in a clean, trustworthy interface.

Community & Engagement: The platform empowers civic tech developers, journalists, and researchers to interact with structured data via an API.



2. Technical Requirements

Frontend (Web Application):

Framework: Django (Python) with server-side rendering using Django Templates.

Data Visualization: Integrates with Redash for query-based dashboards and custom visualizations.


Backend (Web & API):

Web Application: Django handles routing, business logic, and web requests.

API Service: FastAPI.

Endpoints: Includes /members, /bills, /committees, and /votes.

Documentation: Swagger UI automatically generated by FastAPI.


Data Pipeline & Storage:

ETL & Orchestration: Airflow

Database: PostgreSQL 

Data Access: Redash for advanced querying and visualizations.


Source Control & Deployment:

Versioning: GitHub, open-source under the Hasadna organization.

Assumptions: Deployment infrastructure, CI/CD, and hosting remain flexible and will be determined during implementation.

6. Site Structure & Routing

Primary Navigation Structure:

Home & Global Access:

/ — ראשי (Home with current Knesset spotlight and global search)

/search — חיפוש מתקדם (Unified advanced search)

/developers — למפתחים (API documentation for developers)


Knesset Sessions:

/knesset — רשימת כנסת (Index of all Knesset sessions with search/filter)

/knesset/[knesset_number] — דף כנסת (Single hub page for specific Knesset session)


Canonical Entity Pages (Global, cross-session):

/mks — רשימת ח״כים (Global MK list)

/mks/[mk_id] — פרופיל ח״כ (Individual MK profile)

/parties — רשימת סיעות (Global parties list)

/parties/[party_id] — פרופיל סיעה (Party detail page)

/bills — רשימת הצעות חוק (Global bills list)

/bills/[bill_id] — דף הצעת חוק (Bill detail page)

/committees — רשימת ועדות (Global committees list)

/committees/[committee_id] — דף ועדה (Committee detail page)

/laws — מאגר חוקים (Global laws database)

/laws/[law_id] — דף חוק (Individual law page)


Static Pages:

/report-bug — דיווח על תקלה (Bug report form)

/about, /privacy, /contact — Standard informational pages


Knesset Hub Page Sections:

Each Knesset session page (/knesset/[knesset_number]) serves as a comprehensive hub with anchor-navigable sections:

#overview — Overview widgets (coalition summary, government, quick stats)

#timeline — Timeline of key events (formation, reshuffles, dissolution)

#parties — Parties list with coalition/opposition badges

#members — MKs roster displaying key positions prominently

#committees — Active committees in the session

#bills — Bills introduced and laws passed during the session


Routing Principles:

Hub-based architecture: Each Knesset session has one comprehensive page

Canonical entity URLs: All entities (MKs, parties, bills) have global, cross-session pages

Anchor navigation: Within-page navigation using URL fragments for quick access

ID-based routing: All entity routes use numeric IDs (slugs deferred to future phases)
