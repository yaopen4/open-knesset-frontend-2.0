## 1. Project Overview

### Summary
The project is a comprehensive revamp of the "Open Knesset" platform (https://oknesset.org/). The primary goal is to make Israeli parliamentary data accessible and provide behavioral insights for citizens, empowering them to understand and track the actions of their elected officials.

    - Pages per session target: > 5 pages.
- **Accessibility & Understanding**:
    - Achievement of a 100/100 Lighthouse score for technical accessibility.
    - Positive qualitative feedback on data clarity.
