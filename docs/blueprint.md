- Primary color: Deep blue (#0F4C94), for trust and authority.
- Background color: Light gray (#F2F2F2), provides a neutral backdrop, desaturated from the primary color.
- Accent color: Teal (#00838F), for call-to-actions and highlights; this complements the primary blue but offers enough contrast to stand out.

- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for a modern yet approachable feel suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Employs a 12-column responsive grid with a maximum container width of 1200px, ensuring content is well-organized and readable on all screen sizes.
- Uses subtle transitions (150-300ms with ease-in-out easing) for menu and sidebar animations, maintaining a smooth user experience without excessive motion.
